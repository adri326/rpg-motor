#Rpg-motor
(this is a temporal name)
##What's this?
This project is in hard developement, it is more an idea than a game. This is a PHP/HTML/JS game engine, based on the possibilities of creating rpgs.
This project will give you the ability to create your own rpg parties, with your friends, to play with them or to be the GM, create your map, use custome tiles graphisms, use custom scripts and highly personalizable settings.
But, as I said, it is in WIP.
